# Todos 
- Write tests for sequence checker of grouper
- Conversion: assure xmp-tags are maintained after conversion (especially for videos: xmp:date is vanished) by reading them before conversion and writing them to result
- new flag --filedialog to enable selection of folders/files on which to apply the current stage command
- bug: mp4-files don't get xmp:Date written and are missing longitude and latitude gps values
- bug: unknown bug (maybe due to a nextcloud bug or virtual files) causes deleted files to be present in comepletely unrelated directories. Example: ![alt text](2024-09-30_Bug.png) It is interesting, that the first folder contains a 'ÃŸ' whereas the correct folder uses 'ss'. This was changed by me due to issues in xmp-metadata.
- bug: stage history writes sourcefile sometimes
- feature: check if all stages were passed during aggregation using history of xmp:contributor
- bug: HEAP CORRUPTION ERROR during conversion of 768 mediafiles. Happened 2024-10-13. Apparently no jpg was destroyed, but some dngs were corrupted. 
  - Happened again. Both Times on root dir of convert with 768 files and unrestricted nr of processes in processpool.
  - Second time 20 _preview.jpgs were created and 4 exiftool-temp files.
  - Reducing the nr of processes to 8 worked on the exact same files.
- feature: make it possible to disable interpolation in localize
